    <h1>Migrania - Migraine App</h1>
    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p><strong>Usage Data Collection</strong></p>
    <p>I use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage data to improve the app. This data helps me understand how users interact with the app and make informed decisions about feature development and user experience improvements.</p>
    <p>The data collected by Firebase Analytics includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>App usage statistics</li>
        <li>Device information</li>
        <li>General location data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is collected anonymously and cannot be used to identify individual users.</p>
    <p><strong>Personal Information and Health Data</strong></p>
    <p>I do not collect, use, save, or have access to any of your personal data recorded in the Migrania app for iOS, except for the anonymous usage data mentioned above.</p>
    <p>Settings and personal data related to the Migrania app are stored only on your device. You might be asked to provide access to your health data to log symptoms and track your migraines within the app. This health data is stored securely on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers. I don't process or have access to this information.</p>
    <p>If you enter any data such as headache symptoms or medication usage, it is saved locally on your device and is not shared with anyone unless you choose to share it.</p>
    <p>By using the Migrania app, you agree to this privacy policy, including the collection of anonymous usage data through Firebase Analytics.</p>

Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read or tracked in the Migrania app.</p>
    <p><strong>Data Security</strong></p>
    <p>I take reasonable precautions to protect your data. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
